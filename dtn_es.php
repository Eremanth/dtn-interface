<p class="style40" align="justify">It is the DTN's task to <b>find and follow up on the best rated youngsters and french internationals</b>. 
Its duties are fastidious and repetitive, but essential. 
Our organization is based on the willingness we share to offer basic logistic support to the national teams coaches.
</p><p class="style40" align="justify">
We did have a few rough times in the past, but our hierarchical and operational structures are now running smoothly. 
<b>The staff is ever-evoluting</b>; you can take a closer look on the <u><a href="dtn_members.php">members' page</a></u>.
</p><p class="style40" align="justify">
Every member, also known as a DTN, is only in charge of a few players of the same position 
(usually the one he trains players in). 
<b>They must regularly update the players they follow directly with their owners.</b> They gather data about the player's skills, the number of weeks trained since the last update, the training planned by the owner as well as any plan to stop this training or even sell the player.
</p><p class="style40" align="justify">
As it can be easily understood, the central role of a DTN, beyond being a scout, is to be a communicator. 
<b>Keeping good relations with the player's owners is absolutely vital !</b>
</p><p class="style40" align="justify"><br>
The DTN works privately, but publishes an important part of its database so that it keeps its work 
<b>available to the greatest number of people, and stimulates interest from the community to the French national teams</b>. 
Therefore, an interesting number of rankings based on international standards are available on the <u><a href="dtn_tops.php">tops</a></u> page.
We publish as well the different prerequisites and profiles we are looking for to bolster both the <u><a href="dtn_a.php">A</a></u> 
and <u><a href="dtn_u20.php">u20</a></u> national sides.
</p><p class="style40" align="justify">
As a conclusion, and in hope you will help us in our scouting job, we invite you to submit your team to an analysis using the 
above-mentionned prerequisites and profiles on <u><a href="dtn_submitting.php">this page</a></u>.
