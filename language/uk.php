The <font color="#2F4399"><strong>DTN</strong></font> is reborn. This entity is responsible for searching, scouting, and following-up on potential international players. <br>
<br>
The search for new players is entirely done by the members in the first 4-5 weeks of the season. (7 first weeks for players with excellent secondary skills). It\'s a quick but fastidious task. Other groups will help us find those players that may have gone unnoticed. <br>
<br>
Despite experiencing some problems when we first started, the staff is now ever-evoluting. <font color="#2F4399"><strong>DTN</strong></font>\'s staff-members are each assigned a specific positon (preferably the one they are training), and need to update the players regularly, working together with the club managers. Their role is one of communication, and relating well with the owners of potential stars is essential! As for the data collected, they look for all of the player\'s skills and attributes, the number of weeks of training since the last skill update, when and if the manager plans on training or selling the player, and so on. <br>
<br>
The <font color="#2F4399"><strong>DTN</strong></font> works in a private manner, but publishes parts of its data for more transparency and encouraging others, so that everyone feels concerned by the national team. The public part of this entity is still under construction. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, www.ht-fff.org takes care of publishing the requirements given by the French national coaches, whoever they are, together with a form that allows submitting players directly to the <font color="#2F4399"><strong>DTN</strong></font>.

define("DTN_MEMBERS",'Here are the \'famous\' members of the DTN... They are responsible, away from the spotlights, for hunting potential french internationals around HT-Planet. This public listing was requested by many foreign managers who were worried about receiving requests from persons pretending to be part of the DTN. This was a no-brainer, especially since we have some 
members from other leagues as well.<br>
<br>
I would like to take this opportunity for thanking all those persons who are giving some of their time for HT-France.<br>

define("DTN_U20",'
National selections are not an essential or vital part of Hattrick, but have a strong symbolical role and help gather together the users from a nation. It is the flagship of a community, who in return helps it prosper and achieve new goals. <br>
<br>
The <strong>U20</strong> team is made of the 17 to 20 years old players in each HT-Nation, even though 17 years old are seldom selected; their future is usually quite uncertain at this age and older players, with 1 to 3 seasons of training under their belt, logically have better skills. <br>
In every nation, the U20 team is largely dependent on both luck and organization, whereas the A team mostly relies on a long-term approach. <br>
<br>
If we are to seriously compete with hattrick\'s big guns, it will begin with the U20 selection, conditional to a large number of french users and the level of their youth squads. When will we first participate in a U20 World Cup semi-finals ? When will we get our first medal ? <br>
<br>
You can find below the minimum requirements as announced by the<strong> U20</strong> coach. <br>
Those requirements are applicable for season 24. <br>
If one of your players is close to being eligible, don\'t hesitate submitting him, as his secondary skills could possibly compensate. <br>
Please remember those are only the minimum requirements, and not a guaranteed selection indicator.

define("DTN_A",'National selections are not an essential or vital part of Hattrick, but have a strong symbolical role and help gather together the users from a nation. It is the flagship of a community, who in return helps it prosper and achieve new goals. <br>
<br>
The A team is built using the best players of a nation that are over 20 years of age. Contrary to the way the U20 team works, experience and long term development are the keys for the senior selection\'s success. The best players are not always selected if the timing is not right. <br>
<br>
Concerning France\'s chances of winning trophies, it will undoubtedly take longer for the seniors to challenge for titles. Hattrick\'s most powerful nations all have a very large pool of top quality players to choose from, but we are confident we will be able to compete for the highest honours in a few seasons if we stay well organized, and if we keep on remembering that tactical intelligence is the prime factor for success...and failure. <br>
